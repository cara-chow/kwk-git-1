    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h2>My KWK & Coding Journey</h2>
    <p>I first learned to code my freshman year of high school. My high school required us to take computer science courses, and throughout high school, I took classes on iPhone app develop and AI creativity. Two summmers ago, I was a Kode With Klossy scholar at the AI/ML camp in Washington, DC! I had the absolute best time! My team and I coded a mobile app that used image recognition software to generate custome recipes from leftover food and ingredients. I'm super excited to return to KWK this summmer as a participant in this challenge, and I can't wait to get to know all of you!</p>
